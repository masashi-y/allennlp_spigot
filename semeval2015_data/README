1) Place the SemEval 2015 original data in folders "train" and "test".
The directory contents should be:

train/cs.psd.sdp
train/cz.pas.sdp
train/en.dm.sdp
train/en.pas.sdp
train/en.psd.sdp
train/en.sb.bn.cpn

test/cs.id.psd.sdp
test/cs.ood.psd.sdp
test/cz.id.pas.sdp
test/en.id.dm.sdp
test/en.id.pas.sdp
test/en.id.psd.sdp
test/en.id.sb.bn.cpn
test/en.ood.dm.sdp
test/en.ood.pas.sdp
test/en.ood.psd.sdp
test/en.ood.sb.bn.cpn

(the *.cpn files can be found in the open/ subdirectories.)

2) Type:

cd scripts
./generate_all_splits.sh

This will create folders "dm", "pas", "psd" where the train/dev/test splits
will be stored.

3) To train and test, build the parser (explained in the main README) and run the `train.sh` and `test.sh` scripts in the `NeurboParser` and `MeurboParser` directories as desired.

It should take a few hours to train and run the semantic parsers.
